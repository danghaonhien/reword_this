## âœ… Step-by-Step Setup (for Engineers)

### 1. Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/reword-this-extension
cd reword-this-extension

```

### 4. Build Chrome Extension

```
Copy contents from `dist/` into Chromeâ€™s `chrome://extensions` â†’ Load unpacked.

### 5. Context Menu
Set up background script to detect right-click â†’ open popup window with the selected text passed to it.

### 6. Core Logic
- `Textarea` takes input
- User selects tone or clicks Surprise
- Request sent to `/rewrite` with `{text, tone}`
- Response shown in Result panel

### 7. Gamification (XP & Streaks)
- Save streak and XP in LocalStorage
- Add XP after every successful rewrite
- Reset streak if no rewrite within 24h

### 8. Privacy
- No user data stored externally
- Prompts + rewrites handled client-side only or via secure API proxy
