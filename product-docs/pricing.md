# pricing.md â€” Reword This

## ðŸŽ¯ Pricing Strategy Overview
Our goal is to:
- Make onboarding frictionless with a generous free tier
- Monetize via productivity users who value tone control and personalization
- Keep infrastructure costs low to remain profitable even with free users

---

## ðŸ†“ Free Tier
**Includes:**
- 10 rewrites per day
- Access to 4 basic tones (Clarity, Friendly, Formal, Gen Z)
- Surprise Me mode (limited to 1/day)
- Rewrite Battle mode (limited to 1/day)
- Local XP tracking

**Why it works:**
- Offers enough value to hook daily users
- Encourages sharing via Surprise Me output
- Gives users time to build habits (and streaks)

**Free Tier Cost Estimate:**
- OpenAI (GPT-4-turbo or GPT-3.5):
  - $0.0015/request for GPT-3.5 (avg 100-token prompt)
  - Max 10 requests/user/day = ~$0.015/user/day = ~$0.45/user/month (at worst)

**Free User Cost Breakeven:**
- ~5% conversion rate to $5/month = sustainable
- If GPT costs rise, switch to Claude or use GPT-3.5 with tone-optimized prompts

---

## ðŸ’Ž Premium Tier - $5/month
**Includes:**
- Unlimited rewrites
- All 10+ tone options
- Battle of the Rewrites mode
- XP Leaderboard + Custom Tone Builder
- Priority API access (faster responses)

---

## ðŸ’° Future Monetization Options
